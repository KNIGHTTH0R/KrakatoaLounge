       <h3>Our five year anniversay party.</h3>"We admit full on bias when it comes to the BottleNeck Lounge. It's an important little piece of the CHS and Central District News puzzle... Erin Nestor and her BottleNeck have been part of both sites from the beginning as an advertiser and a community member adding comments and news tips along the way... Happy 5th birthday, neighbors."</li>

Doors opened at 2pm, races began at 3pm, but the real action started at 4pm with the best hat and best dressed competition.</li>
